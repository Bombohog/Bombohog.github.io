# Welcome to the world copy/paste

This is my world of copy/paste where anything is possible.

## Who am i?
```markdown "Hello World"``` i am a student at Zealand studying to become an AP, meaning computer science.

My name is Lasse and i am 23 years old.
I am personally very interested in programming in all differents aspects but most of all in the world of gaming.

I started out "programming" in my public school days, where i got to programm some games, but i was so interested in games that i wanted to learn more about programming and therefore i went to HTX in EUC Køge where i went on the programming B and Mathatics A course, and from there i ended up here in Zealand where i hope to learn a lot more than i know now.

### How knowledgeable am i
If i myself had to give a guess i would be maybe at this point:

Java: 2%

C#: 3%

VB.net: 4%

HTML: 2.5%

PHP: 1%

Javascript: 2%
